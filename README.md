### Introduction to CSS
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, gives websites style.
- Using CSS, you can change properties like color, spacing, fonts, positioning, animations, and more.
- HTML provides the structure, while CSS styles the appearance.

### Understanding CSS Structure
- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Property:** The aspect of the element you want to change (e.g., color, width).
- **Value:** The specific change you want to apply to the property.
- Example:
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

### Four Steps to Writing CSS
1. **Choose an HTML element** - this is your selector.
2. **Add opening and closing curly braces.**
3. **Inside the braces, choose a property and give it a value, separated by a colon.**
4. **End with a semicolon.**

### Common CSS Properties & Values
- **Properties:** There are hundreds, including `color`, `background-color`, `width`, `text-align`, `font-size`.
- **Values:** They differ depending on the property.
- **Examples:**
    - `color: red;`
    - `width: 400px;`
    - `font-size: 20px;`
